## To submit a resource
If you'd like to contribute a resource or tool, perform the following steps: 
- Check the [previous form responses](http://bit.ly/DCSG-submissions) to ensure that your tool/resource has not been previously submitted.
- Submit new entries using the form [below](#submit-a-resource) ([or via this Google Form](http://bit.ly/data-curation-resources)). 
- Submitted entries will be reviewed by members of the Portage Curation Expert Group. Once approved on the Google Sheet, a page will be created in the [Tools & Resources list](/tools-and-resources) by the next day.
