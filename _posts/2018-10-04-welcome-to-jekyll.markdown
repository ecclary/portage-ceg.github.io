It is really easy to create 'bloggable' content in [Jeykll](https://jekyllrb.org), the coding language that forms the backbone of this site. This page, while rendered in `html` is actually a plain text document written in [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
