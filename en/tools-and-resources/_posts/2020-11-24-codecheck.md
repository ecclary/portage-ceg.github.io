From the CODECHECK [website](https://codecheck.org.uk/): CODECHECK tackles one of the main challenges of computational research by supporting codecheckers with a workflow, guidelines and tools to evaluate computer programs underlying scientific papers. The independent time-stamped runs conducted by codecheckers will award a "certificate of executable computation" and increase availability, discovery and reproducibility of crucial artefacts for computational sciences.
