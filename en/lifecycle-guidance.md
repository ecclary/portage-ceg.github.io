## Planning
*(study design, data management planning, research ethics application)*

This is a researcher focused stage in which a project is conceived and designed. Curators, data managers, and research data management librarians may be asked to assist researchers in the data management planning aspects of a research project. The research team should consider how the data will be collected or generated, structured, described and documented, and how the data will be stored and managed throughout the project. It is also beneficial to plan where and how the data will be shared at the project's conclusion. If data or code from external sources will be used in the research project, their terms of use should be noted.

Tools such as the [DMP Assistant](https://assistant.portagenetwork.ca/) will be useful for thinking through data management in the various stages of the [research data lifecycle](https://old.dataone.org/data-life-cycle).  

*Tools and resources in the following categories may be helpful:* [active data management](https://portage-ceg.github.io/tools-and-resources/#active+data+management), [data management planning](https://portage-ceg.github.io/tools-and-resources/#data+management+planning), [data repositories](https://portage-ceg.github.io/tools-and-resources/#data+repositories), [documentation](https://portage-ceg.github.io/tools-and-resources/#documentation), [file formats](https://portage-ceg.github.io/tools-and-resources/#file+formats), [file naming](https://portage-ceg.github.io/tools-and-resources/#file+naming), [Indigenous knowledge](https://portage-ceg.github.io/tools-and-resources/#indigenous+knowledge), [sensitive data](https://portage-ceg.github.io/tools-and-resources/#sensitive+data), [metadata standards](https://portage-ceg.github.io/tools-and-resources/#metadata+standards), [ontologies](https://portage-ceg.github.io/tools-and-resources/#ontologies), [readme files](https://portage-ceg.github.io/tools-and-resources/#readme+files), [RDM](https://portage-ceg.github.io/tools-and-resources/#rdm), [research data licensing](https://portage-ceg.github.io/tools-and-resources/#research+data+licensing), [software licensing](https://portage-ceg.github.io/tools-and-resources/#software+licensing), [version control](https://portage-ceg.github.io/tools-and-resources/#version+control).

## Creating and Analyzing
*(data collection, analysis, synthesis)*

In this researcher-focused stage, observations are made and datasets are created. In some cases, previously collected data or code from external sources may be reused or repurposed. There should be a plan in place to maintain and assure data quality and data integrity throughout the research project. The steps and methods used to process and analyze raw data should be documented, and any changes to the raw data files should be noted.

Descriptive metadata and documentation are an important part of this stage, and curators, data librarians and research support staff may have a role to play in creating or enhancing documentation and description.

*Tools and resources in the following categories may be helpful:* [active data management](https://portage-ceg.github.io/tools-and-resources/#data+management+planning), [codebooks](https://portage-ceg.github.io/tools-and-resources/#codebooks), [data cleaning](https://portage-ceg.github.io/tools-and-resources/#data+cleaning), [data dictionaries](https://portage-ceg.github.io/tools-and-resources/#data+dictionaries), [data reuse](https://portage-ceg.github.io/tools-and-resources/#data+reuse), [data visualization](https://portage-ceg.github.io/tools-and-resources/#data+visualization), [data wrangling](https://portage-ceg.github.io/tools-and-resources/#data+wrangling), [documentation](https://portage-ceg.github.io/tools-and-resources/#documentation), [file formats](https://portage-ceg.github.io/tools-and-resources/#file+formats), [file naming](https://portage-ceg.github.io/tools-and-resources/#file+naming), [metadata](https://portage-ceg.github.io/tools-and-resources/#metadata), [metadata standards](https://portage-ceg.github.io/tools-and-resources/#metadata+standards), [qualitative data](https://portage-ceg.github.io/tools-and-resources/#qualitative+data), [quantitative data](https://portage-ceg.github.io/tools-and-resources/#quantitative+data), [readme files](https://portage-ceg.github.io/tools-and-resources/#readme+files), [security](https://portage-ceg.github.io/tools-and-resources/#security), [version control](https://portage-ceg.github.io/tools-and-resources/#version+control).

## Sharing
*(publication, data deposit & sharing)*

In this stage, data are prepared for sharing, publishing, and preservation. It is important to consider what data can be shared, and any legal or ethical obligations that may limit how the data can be shared.  The research team may need to select an appropriate disciplinary repository, a generalist repository, or make other arrangements to share their data.

Some repositories have a self-mediated deposit and publication process, while others may have dedicated curators to assist researchers. There may be specific recommendations or requirements for what file formats and metadata standards can be used, what accompanying documentation should be included, and what licenses can be applied. Various factors such as the repository policies for stewardship and data retention, mechanisms for user support, and the ability to assign unique identifiers should be considered.  Tools such as the [Repository Finder tool](https://repositoryfinder.datacite.org/) and [re3data](https://www.re3data.org/), and guidance such as [The TRUST Principles for Digital Repositories](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-020-0486-7) can aid the selection process.

## Appraising
*(data assessment, evaluation, review)*

In this stage of the lifecycle, a data deposit is reviewed for completeness and compliance with a repositoryâ€™s terms of use, and the overall FAIRness of the deposit may be assessed. A curator may work with the research team to enhance the usability and accessibility of the dataset. The Data Curation Network's [CURATED checklist](https://datacurationnetwork.org/resources/) is one framework that will guide a curator through the curation process. Steps include checking and understanding the data files and associated documentation, requesting missing information, augmenting metadata for findability, transforming files if necessary, evaluating the FAIRness of a deposit, and documenting all curation activities.

Some of the tasks a curator may perform:
- Check datasets for compliance with the repository terms of service
- Perform quality assurance through file audit and code review
- Assess files for disclosure risk or intellectual property concerns
- Review, enhance, or create documentation
- Help select an appropriate license for the data
- Make recommendations on file formats for accessibility in the short and long term
- Verify metadata quality and augment or restructure to facilitate discoverability and interoperability
- Request missing or ambiguous information or changes from data creators

## Archiving and Preserving
*(long-term preservation, study close-down)*

In this stage, a curator or preservationist may take steps to ensure short-term access to research data, and the long-term preservation and retention of the data. Preservation actions may include file validation, creating preservation metadata and documentation, assigning representation information, and ensuring acceptable data structures. Files may be migrated or transformed for storage or to help ensure they remain accessible over time. It is important to document all actions to ensure the integrity and authenticity of the data. Data should be stored in a secure manner, and the length of retention may depend on the repository policies, or external requirements, such as legal obligations.

## Reusing
*(access, use, reuse and repurpose)*

In this stage, data or code are re-purposed or re-used. Robust access controls and authentication procedures may be applicable.
Ideally data and code that have been published will have a persistent identifier or accession number, and a license or clearly stated terms of use. These research outputs may be integrated with other sources, or processed and analyzed in new ways. New data or derived products may be created and published. Data and software citation should be encouraged.
