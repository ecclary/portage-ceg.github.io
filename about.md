The Curation Expert Group (CEG) is working with [Portage](https://portagenetwork.ca/) to identify, evaluate, and promote best practices in preparing data and metadata for research, dissemination, and preservation in Canada. Curation involves the practices, techniques, and tools to improve the quality of data and metadata, to make the data transportable across systems, to facilitate its dissemination and reuse, and to enable its interoperability with other data sources.

The purpose of the Curation Expert Group (CEG) is to advise Portage on best practices for curating research data (i) within research projects and (ii) at the data repository level (which may be supported by a university, a regional consortium, a discipline, a national service, or an international organization). This group will also work to identify data workflows that incorporate RDM best practices and standards and that employ automated methods supporting the production of quality data and metadata both in research and in preservation.
